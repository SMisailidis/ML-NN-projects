# ML-NN-Projects

This repository contains machine learning and neural network projects developed as part of coursework and research in Applied Informatics. Each project applies different techniques of data analysis, classification, and deep learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Mushroom Classification
- **Goal:** Classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** using their physical and chemical characteristics.  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Mushroom Dataset.  
- **Methods:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, MLP Classifier.  
- **Outcome:** Achieved high accuracy, showing that ML can be a valuable tool for public health and food safety.

### 2. COVID-19 Prediction from X-Ray Images
- **Goal:** Predict whether a patient has **COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, or is healthy** based on chest X-ray images.  
- **Dataset:** Publicly available X-ray datasets (via Kaggle).  
- **Methods:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16, ResNet50.  
- **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab with GPU acceleration.  
- **Outcome:** Models achieved high accuracy (>90%) in classifying medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in medical imaging.
